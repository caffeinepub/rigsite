# RIG Institute Website - React + Internet Computer

This is a pixel-perfect replica of the RIG Institute website built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and deployed on the Internet Computer using Motoko backend.

## Important Note on Technology Stack

**This project uses React + Motoko (Internet Computer) instead of PHP + MySQL + cPanel** as specified in the original request. This is due to the fixed technology stack of the development environment.

### Key Differences:
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (instead of static HTML/PHP)
- **Backend**: Motoko canister on Internet Computer (instead of PHP + MySQL)
- **Authentication**: Internet Identity (instead of traditional login)
- **Deployment**: Internet Computer network (instead of cPanel)
- **Data Storage**: Motoko stable storage (instead of MySQL database)
